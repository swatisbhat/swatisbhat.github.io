A [symmetric image encryption algorithm][paper-link] based on bit-wise operations. The block ciphering algorithm uses a combination of substitution and transposition techniques that use **dynamic SBOX and TBOX** generated using the secret key for every block of data. **Correlation analysis**, **histogram analysis** and **key sensitivity analysis** was performed to analyse the strength of the algorithm.
