A web application in **Flask** that recommends books to a user based on a user input book. Functionalities include **search and retrieval of books**, **to-read list**, **favourites list** and a **book recommender system**. A comparison was made of quality of recommendations based on simple item(and user) based  collaborative filtering methods and one that used item(and user) based collaborative filtering [leveraging author rankings obtained from item-item similarities][paper-link].
