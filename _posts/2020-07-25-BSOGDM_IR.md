A **document retrieval system** that uses **Bees Swarm Optimization** guided by data mining techniques. Data mining techniques include **clustering** of documents and [extraction of **frequent closed itemsets**][fcp-paper-link](sets of document terms or keywords) from the document clusters using **reduced-PCT(Pattern Count Tree)**. Extracted information from these techniques was used to guide BSO and hence enhance the performance of the retrieval system.
