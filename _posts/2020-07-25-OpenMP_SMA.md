**Study and analysis of parallelization** of String Matching Algorithms. Implemented **Naive string matching algorithm** and **Boyer Moore Horspool algorithm** in parallel in **OpenMP**. A detailed study and analysis of performance of the mentioned algorithms in series and in parallel based on different parameters was performed; on **gene files of different sizes**, using **patterns of various lengths** and **varying number of threads**.
